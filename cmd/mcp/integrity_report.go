// receipt the other MCP tools return.
//
// Two rules govern the wording, because this output is read by an agent that
// will take it at face value:
//
//   - A failing check must never be softened. "warn" and "fail" stay distinct,
//     and the check's own Detail is passed through verbatim rather than
//     re-summarised, so the receipt cannot end up describing something the
//     metrics contradict.
//   - A check that errored is reported as errored. It is neither a pass nor a
//     failure, and the aggregate score already accounts for it as a lower
//     bound rather than pretending the run was clean.
