# Build release artifacts into assets/releases/v<version>/.
#
# Two products ship from one release:
#   - reponest-mcp  : pure Go, zero CGO. Cross-compiles for every target from
#                     any host, so this script can always produce all four.
#   - reponest      : the Wails desktop shell. It links GTK/WebKit on Linux and
#                     needs the native toolchain on macOS and Windows, so it can
#                     only be produced on each target's own CI runner - exactly
#                     what .github/workflows/release.yml does on a tag push.
#
# The script therefore builds what the host can build and says plainly what it
# skipped, rather than failing halfway and leaving a half-populated release
# directory. A partially-populated release that looks complete is worse than an
# obviously incomplete one.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/build-release-assets.sh              # build for the current version
#   ./scripts/build-release-assets.sh --mcp-only   # skip desktop, never fail on it
