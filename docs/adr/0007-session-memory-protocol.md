# ADR-0007: Session Memory Protocol (context / handoff Dual Tools)

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-09-28
- Related: [ADR-0006](0006-scope-freeze.md) (core loop first), [ADR-0005](0005-service-layer.md) (service layer unification)

## Background

ADR-0006 defined the core loop as "Discover → Understand → Record → Retrieve → AI use", but the two ends of the loop are broken from an agent's perspective:

1. **Session start**: after receiving a new task, an agent must chain 3-4 calls itself (`projects_list` → `notes_search` → `notes_read`) to assemble project context; most agents skip this step entirely and start with zero context.
2. **Session end**: what the agent learned (decisions, gotchas, next steps) vanishes with the session. `notes_create` exists but carries no protocol — the agent does not know when to write or what structure to write, and humans cannot predict the output format.

For the "AI project memory layer" narrative to hold, memory must happen **automatically at session boundaries** rather than relying on users remembering to save.

## Decision

Three new MCP tools form the session memory protocol (cold start included):

### `reponest_context` (session start)

A single call returns a Markdown document of the project's full context:

- Tech stack / README summary / language shares / dependencies / contributors / activity (from the `repo_meta` mining cache; when uncached, background async mining runs and is declared in the document)
- Recent commits (live git log)
- Open todos
- Highly relevant knowledge notes; **notes tagged `handoff` sort first** (they record how the previous session ended)

Project resolution protocol (`ResolveProject`): `project_id` exact resolution → `project_name` fuzzy match on name/path → auto-resolution when called with no arguments and exactly one project exists. On multiple matches, a project directory (with ID table) is returned for the agent to choose; the context of a wrongly guessed project is never injected.

### `reponest_handoff` (session end)

A structured handoff protocol. Inputs: `summary` (required) + `changes` / `decisions` / `gotchas` / `next_steps` (arrays, at least one non-empty) + `agent` (writer identity). Rendered into a fixed Markdown template and persisted (`kind=knowledge`, `source=mcp`, tags automatically include `handoff`).

The fixed template is deliberate: the heading structure is a contract between the writer and all future readers (humans + agents), and `reponest_context` relies on the `handoff` tag to sort it to the top.

### `reponest_scan` (cold start)

The session memory protocol presumes projects already exist in the database. Only the desktop app could previously perform "seed scan roots + scan", making the documented claim "MCP requires no desktop app" empty talk — a pure-MCP installation's `reponest_context` would only return "no projects". To fix this, scan capability moves down into the service layer and is exposed as a third tool:

- `Service.EnsureDefaultScanRoots`: on first run, seeds the platform-default scan roots (`scan_roots_seeded` marker; existing scan roots are left untouched);
- `Service.ScanNow`: synchronously runs the full scan pipeline and returns repo/project counts (`TriggerScan` is kept for the desktop's background async scenario; both share the `scanning` mutex);
- `reponest_scan`: calls both, compressing the first-run funnel from "install → scan → star → refresh → use" to "install → `reponest_scan` → `reponest_context`".

The desktop first-launch flow also switches to reusing `Service.EnsureDefaultScanRoots`, keeping behavior identical on both ends.

## Rationale

- **Usable with zero arguments**: a single-project installation gets full context straight from `reponest_context()`, reducing the cost of "loading memory" to one call.
- **Cross-agent**: handoffs land in local SQLite rather than any agent-private memory format; a handoff written by Claude Code reads directly in Cursor.
- **Service layer sharing**: all three tools are implemented in `internal/service` (`context.go` / `handoff.go` / `scan.go`), and the desktop reuses the same implementation (ADR-0005 layering).
- **No guessing on multiple matches**: wrong context is more dangerous than no context; on ambiguity, a directory is returned for the agent to choose again.

## Future Directions (open)

- Automatic session capture: parse `~/.claude/projects/*/*.jsonl` to generate session summaries (zero manual involvement; privacy and size to be evaluated)
- Multi-source memory import: memory formats of Cursor, Codex, and OpenCode
- Semantic retrieval: local embeddings (evaluate sqlite-vec) to complement FTS5's literal-match blind spot
- Claude Code hook integration documentation: SessionEnd hook triggering `reponest_handoff` automatically
