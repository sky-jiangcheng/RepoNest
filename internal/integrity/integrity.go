// Package integrity answers the question nothing else in RepoNest can answer:
// how much of the knowledge base can be trusted?
//
// The product promise is a structured, searchable, trustworthy model of the
// local Git projects, and an AI is the main consumer of that model. Nothing on
// the write path can tell us whether the model still matches reality. The FTS5
// index can drift away from project_notes, after which search silently returns
// fewer hits than there are notes and no query anywhere reports an error. A
// database can sit several migrations behind the binary that is reading it. The
// repo_meta knowledge cache the AI quotes can be months old and still be served
// as if it were current. ADR 0006 froze the scope and TODO.md lists the
// remaining work, but decisions are not evidence. This package is the data-side
// receipt that the model was actually verified - the counterpart of archify's
// artifact checks, which have no database equivalent.
//
// Contract for every check in this package:
//
//   - Read-only. Only Query and QueryRow are used: no Exec, no transaction, no
//     PRAGMA. A report can therefore be produced while a scan is writing to the
//     same file, and this package can never repair - or damage - what it
//     inspects. TestSourceIsReadOnly enforces it by walking the sources.
//   - Never fatal. A query error, a missing table or a panic becomes a
//     StatusError entry for that single check, so one broken check can never
//     hide the other five results.
//   - Empty-database safe. A fresh install has no projects, no notes and no
//     indexes; every check must answer "pass" or "warn" there, never crash and
//     never claim more than it knows.
//   - Existence is not evidence. The failure mode this package exists to catch
//     is the one that looks healthy: a version stamp that lies about the
//     columns behind it, an index rowid that hides stale terms, a cache row
//     holding nothing but column defaults. A rowid count, a stored version
//     number or a row count are all satisfied by those states, so every check
//     verifies the thing the number stands for, not the number.
